# contributing

ðŸ‘‹ hey! thanks for thinking about contributing! make sure you read the following three sections before contributing.

## pull requests

before you make a pr

1. _create an issue of what you plan to add_
2. _do **not** commit to `dev` or `master` branch_ directly

of course, if you're change is relatively small, this may not be needed.

## commit naming

Rules for commit linting can be found in `commitlintrc.json`

- keep commits short and meaningful
- use the imperative, present tense ('change' rather than 'changed' or 'changes')
- do not capitalize the first letter
- do not add a period
